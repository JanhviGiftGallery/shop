Janhvi: The Gift Gallery | Smart Redirector

Welcome to the official "Signpost" repository for Janhvi: The Gift Gallery.

📖 The Backstory (Why this exists)
This repository serves as a Permanent Redirect Bridge. As a developer using the GitHub Student Developer Pack, I launched my store on a .studio domain. However, knowing that free domains eventually expire or change, I built this "Smart Redirector" to future-proof my physical branding.

The Problem: Printing QR codes that point directly to a temporary domain (.studio) is risky. If the domain changes, the printed codes become garbage. The Solution: This repository! All my printed QR codes point to this GitHub Pages URL. It acts as a permanent middleman that I can update in seconds without ever re-printing a single sticker or business card.

Live Deployment
Permanent QR Link: https://janhvigiftgallery.github.io/shop/

Current Destination: https://www.janhvi.studio (Hosted on Vercel)

Main Development Profile: @CyberPolymath — Where the actual E-commerce engine lives.

How it Works
This is a high-efficiency, zero-cost implementation of a Dynamic Redirect:

Scanner hits the GitHub Pages URL.

index.html executes a meta-refresh and a JavaScript window location change.

User is seamlessly bounced to the latest live version of the shop.

Project Timeline
Feb 8, 2026: Initial deployment of janhvi.studio.

Status: Under Active Development (But yes, you can actually buy things!)

For Developers Reading This
If you're "broke" but want professional-grade redirection for your startup:

Don't use paid third-party QR services that steal your branding.

Do use a dedicated GitHub account and Pages. It gives you a branded URL (yourbrand.github.io) and total control over your traffic for $0.
