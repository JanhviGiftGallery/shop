# Janhvi: The Gift Gallery | Smart Redirector
### Welcome to the permanent "Signpost" for Janhvi: The Gift Gallery.

## The Backstory
This repository serves as a Permanent Redirect Bridge. I launched my store on a .studio domain using the GitHub Student Developer Pack. However, since free domains eventually expire, I built this redirector to future-proof my physical branding.

The Problem: Printing QR codes that point directly to a temporary domain (.studio) is risky. If the domain changes, the printed codes become useless.

The Solution: All my printed QR codes point to this GitHub Pages URL. It acts as a permanent "middleman" that I can update in seconds without ever re-printing a single sticker or business card.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
This is a high-efficiency, zero-cost implementation of a Dynamic Redirect:

Scanner hits this GitHub Pages URL.

index.html executes a meta-refresh and a JavaScript redirect.

User is seamlessly bounced to the latest live version of the shop.

📅 Milestone: February 8, 2026
Today marks the successful live deployment of the e-commerce site.

Status: Under Active Development 🚧

Note: The shop is functional! You can actually browse and buy products at the link above.

💡 Strategy for Student Developers
If you are working with a limited budget but want professional-grade redirection:

Avoid paid third-party QR services that insert their own branding.

Use a dedicated GitHub account and Pages. It provides a branded URL (yourbrand.github.io) and total control over your traffic for $0 forever.
